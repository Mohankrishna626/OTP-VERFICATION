# OTP-VERFICATION
I’ve recently built a Python-based One-Time Password (OTP) Verification System designed to help with email-based user authentication, and I’m excited to share it with you all! This project allows users to receive OTPs to verify their identity for various applications, such as account sign-ups or login processes.
➡️ What the Project Does:
Multiple User Support: You can send OTPs to multiple users in one go, making it useful for batch processes or onboarding new users.
Email Integration: Utilizes Gmail’s SMTP server to send OTPs to users' email addresses securely.
OTP Generation: A random 4-digit OTP is generated for each user, providing an extra layer of security.
User Validation: After receiving the OTP, users are prompted to input it. They have 3 attempts to enter the correct OTP before the verification fails.
Failure Handling: If the user fails to enter the correct OTP within 3 attempts, the system notifies them of the failure and exits the verification process.
➡️ Key Features:
Email Functionality:
The script uses Python’s built-in smtplib and email.mime libraries to send and format OTP emails.
I used Gmail’s SMTP server for sending OTPs, but this can be modified to use any email provider.
Security Mechanism:
The script generates random 4-digit OTPs, ensuring each verification is unique.
Users can input the OTP they receive, and if correct, their verification is successful.
User Experience:
The system is interactive, asking for the user's name and email, followed by their OTP input.
Users have 3 chances to enter the correct OTP before the process terminates with a failure message.
➡️ Key Learnings:
Working with SMTP Servers: Setting up email servers with Python using smtplib can be a valuable skill for building applications that require communication via email.
Random Number Generation: I utilized Python's random module to create OTPs, which is a great way to handle temporary credentials in a secure way.
Basic Security Considerations: While this script is great for learning, it’s important to keep in mind that production-level OTP systems should implement encryption for sensitive data (like email passwords and OTPs) and adopt best practices for secure communication.
